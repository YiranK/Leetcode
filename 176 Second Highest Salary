# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT (
SELECT DISTINCT Salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1, 1)
AS SecondHighestSalary

# use DINSTINCT to deal with the situation where there are only two same numbers of salary, which means no second highest.
# use SELECT() to create a temp table, then SELECT this returned temp table and rename it to second highest salary, then it will initialize to 1, why?
